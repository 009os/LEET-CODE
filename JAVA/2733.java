/*
 * Given an integer array nums containing distinct positive integers, find and return any number from the array that is neither the minimum nor the maximum value in the array, or -1 if there is no such number.

Return the selected integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, the minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 4. Therefore, either 2 or 3 can be valid answers.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Since there is no number in nums that is neither the maximum nor the minimum, we cannot select a number that satisfies the given condition. Therefore, there is no answer.
